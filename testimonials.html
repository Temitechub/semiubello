              Dr. Semiu, has overtime, proven to so many people he is passionate and enthusiastic about his job( lecturing, mentoring and researching). I was privileged to be supervised by him in my M.Sc dissertation at Olabisi Onabanjo University, Nigeria and it has been the best part of my academic journey in life. He is an excellent researcher, despite being approachable, he doesn't give room for mediocrity. It is either perfectly done or not approved."
Abiodun Eleshinloye
Lagos, Nigeria.
I have known Dr. Bello for almost 20 years, first as my student and now as a colleague and co-researcher in media and communication scholarship. Dr. Bello has acquired considerable experiences and possesses requisite skills, insights, culture and competences in teaching, research, mentoring, and administrative tasks in the field of mass communication in Nigeria and abroad. He has consistently published in credible local and international journals across the field of mass communication.
These competencies and his proven scholarship have definitely prepared Dr. Bello for the challenges involved in academic leadership.

              Semiu was my research student at the University of Canterbury. He was a good scholar who always met every deadline I set – often beforehand! The result of his work at Canterbury was a cogent, analytical piece of research, which is now a strong addition to the literature in this field. While working toward his PhD degree, Semiu has also published several articles and book chapters. This was an impressive level of output for someone at this stage of development. He has always been a dedicated academic scholar. I have seen his previous research questions turn to new ones and I have witnessed his appetite for research continues to grow.
As a teacher, Semiu was very adept at Canterbury. I knew he already had teaching experience but I was impressed with his interpersonal skills and his ability to connect with our undergraduate students. He ran two of the tutorial sessions for our large introductory class and was adept at handling the many issues that arose during any semester. Semiu’s skills are extensive. He is extremely organized and an efficient worker. He is entirely self-motivated with high personal standards. He is a creative, intelligent, goal-oriented person and has proven himself to be a strong teacher. He works well with others and is eager to contribute

             I have known Dr. Bello for over 20 years, since his secondary school days as well as an undergraduate trainee in Mass Communication and presently a research colleague. Dr. Bello has demonstrated an impressive academic career over the years. The manifestations could be read convincingly in his efforts moving through all stages of communication training alongside management.
This energetic academic and prolific writer in respect of research articles have dedicated and committed himself to enhancing development of humanity through novel contributions to advance the disciplines of communication and journalism in Nigeria. During his postgraduate master’s training, Dr Bello worked with me on research projects relating to health development and application of communications skill and technology to prevent diseases burden, especially malaria. He is noted for building capacity in students with diligence and high level discipline, preparing them for future challenges. The weakness in this young man is that he works so hard that he forgoes most often his due breaks or holidays until he accomplishes on assignments given to him”

             Dr Semiu Bello: An Angel or a Mortal?
I have been a friend and colleague of Dr Semiu Bello for over two decades. He has his eyes fixed on the stars through his slogan “the sky is the beginning”. With the vision tagged: “Boldstep to Prof.”, Dr Bello draws the blueprint of his academic sojourn right from childhood and pursued it with great zeal.
As a colleague, I can attest to the research prowess of Dr Bello as his research articles numbering over 45 have been published in local and international journals. He is grounded in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. He is well noted for his painstaking efforts in turning up quality research articles at given deadlines.
I am one of the beneficiaries of his mentorship efforts which he has always conducted with passion.
Everywhere he goes, he mentors budding and senior researchers and just like numerous people in and outside Nigeria, my success story will not be complete without a mention of his tutelage.
Dr Bello has this “monitoring spirit”, pursuing you with vigour and adopting alluring techniques for you to aim for the stars just as he has done to himself. The manifestation of this is evidence in the success of my academic session.
The scholar lives by example who sacrifices his time, energy and resources to add value to the lives of others. He has this magical touch on the lives of people who are around him. He benefits his friends and return bad deeds with good ones. He is loved by his foes and it has become a tradition for people to cry when he is taking up new challenges and had to say good bye in any organisation or institution he had found himself in the past.
If an organisation is at its low, the turnaround will definitely be witnessed with the coming on board of Dr Bello. If an organisation seems to be at its optimum, when Dr Bello joins, it will almost get to a stage of utopia. In all higher institutions, groups and organisations he was engaged in the past, his name is written in gold.
While I look forward to seeing more of his intervention in the area of his expertise “Health Communication”, Dr Bello to me, is an angel in the body of man. I mean every bit of statement I made here.

             Dr. Semiu, has overtime, proven to so many people he is passionate and enthusiastic about his job which covers lecturing, mentoring and researching.
I was privileged to be supervised by him in my M.Sc dissertation at Olabisi Onabanjo University, Nigeria and it has been the best part of my academic journey in life.
He is an excellent researcher, despite being approachable, he doesn't give room for mediocrity. It is either perfectly done or not approved.
A very attentive and engaging man who goes above and beyond to ensure his student(s) is well equipped with journals and every necessary resources needed for the success of project work.
Am yet to come across such a humble being with a faultless character who treats people equally with no preference.
In all of my years of knowing Dr.Semiu, I am of the opinion that, he is a research enthusiast, a kind, understanding, supportive, detail-oriented, success griller, a good public speaker , an optimist and a passionate leader. Am super grateful we cross path in life.

               I have established and enjoyed association with Dr. Bello Semiu for over 15 years. He was first my student at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Nigeria but due to his impeccable academic excellence and diligence, we later became colleagues in the same university.
We further became co-PhD candidates at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Dr. Semiu is a matured, diligent man with a research ability of over 45 publications in academic journals both nationally and internationally.
He is also a kind-hearted person, supportive and a natural mentor for others. A testimony of this was his influence in encouraging and supporting 3 other colleagues to pursue their Doctorate Degree alongside himself at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
He is an experienced teacher, a seasoned researcher and well-travelled. He is also a dedicated father and husband.
Kindly accord him all necessary support and engagement.
